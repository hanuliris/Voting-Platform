>>> Project Overview

The Voting Platform is a database-driven application developed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient digital voting system. This project demonstrates the practical application of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts by automating the voting process and managing election data reliably.

The platform allows registered users to cast votes digitally while ensuring that each voter can vote only once. Administrators have control over managing elections, candidates, and monitoring voting results.

>>> Objectives

To replace manual voting with a digital system

To ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate voting

To demonstrate real-world implementation of DBMS concepts

To provide fast and accurate vote counting

>>>> Key Features

Voter registration and authentication

Admin panel for managing elections and candidates

Secure vote casting mechanism

One voter – one vote enforcement

Automatic result calculation

Structured and normalized database

 >>>> Database Design

The system uses a relational database with tables such as:

Voters

Candidates

Elections

Votes

Admin

Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints are used to maintain consistency and integrity.

>>>> Technologies Used

Database: MySQL / SQL

Backend: (Add if applicable – PHP / Node.js / Python, etc.)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Tools: Git, GitHub

>>>> How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

git clone git@github.com:hanuliris/Voting-Platform.git


Import the database file into MySQL

Configure database credentials

Run the application on a local server

>>>> Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with DBMS

Understanding of database relationships and queries

Secure data handling in sensitive applications
