📌 Project Overview

The Voting Platform is a database-driven application developed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient digital voting system. This project demonstrates the practical application of Database Management System (DBMS) concepts by automating the voting process and managing election data reliably.

The platform allows registered users to cast votes digitally while ensuring that each voter can vote only once. Administrators have control over managing elections, candidates, and monitoring voting results.

🎯 Objectives

To replace manual voting with a digital system

To ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate voting

To demonstrate real-world implementation of DBMS concepts

To provide fast and accurate vote counting

⚙️ Key Features
